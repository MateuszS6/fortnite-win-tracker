# Fortnite Win Tracker

The original Fortnite win tracker program created by me in 2020 to track my Fortnite wins accurately!

## How To Use

Place your local win data files in `data/`.
These files are ignored by git.

Data in the added files will be generated (by the program) in the format:
    
    A, B, C

where:
- `A = solos`,
- `B = duos`,
- `C = squads`.
